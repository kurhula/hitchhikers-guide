# Here are some things to keep in mind when working on your project

## Keep code Operating system agnostic

example: appending paths
example: running command line programs from python

## Use logging

See example file

## Avoid hard coding any paths or model parameters in python scripts

put things like this in the config file

## Don't edit the master branch directly

Instead, make your own branch and commit away, then merge back into master when you're done and have tested your code!

## When you install python packages, and push requirements.txt

show with pip freeze
