# Project Set Up

So, you've decided to start a data science project. Great! Now what...?

## Software Setup

### Python

### Git
Install Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Your Favorite IDE
VSCode is a great option for editing Python. It is fast, lightweight, highly configurable, and has some convenient version control integration. It can be downloaded [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Make sure to install the Python extension through the VSCode application.

For some more options and general information about IDEs, check out [this article](https://realpython.com/python-ides-code-editors-guide/#visual-studio-code).

### Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is great for exploratory data analysis, not only because it allows you to quickly change and rerun code, but also because it allows you to easily annotate your code for someone else to follow along and reproduce your work.

## Computer Environment

### Environment Variables

In our project we'll want to import Python modules by using paths relative to the source code directory, so let's add our source code to the PYTHONPATH enironment variable.

We want to use a configuration file for our project, so let's set an environment variable that points to that file.
