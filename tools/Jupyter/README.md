# Jupyter
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) is a tool for creating Notebooks, which are documents that include live runnable code. Notebooks allow us to create readable and reproducable explorations and analyses. It's a sort of standard language for data scientists, on a more human level than code.

## Installation
Consult the [Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for installation instructions. If you have Anaconda installed, you already have Jupyter.

## Usage
Run Jupyter from the command line with `jupyter notebook`. This will open your Jupyter dashboard. You can open a specific notebook by appending the file name, for example `jupyter notebook example.ipynb`.
