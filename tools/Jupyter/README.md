# Jupyter
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) is a tool for creating Notebooks, which are documents that include live runnable code. Notebooks allow us to organize readable and reproducable explorations and analyses. It's sort of a standard language for data scientists.

## Installation
Consult the [Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for installation instructions. If you have Anaconda installed, you already have Jupyter.

## Usage
Run Jupyter from the command line with `jupyter notebook`. This will open your Jupyter dashboard in a web browser. You can open a specific notebook by appending the file name, for example `jupyter notebook example.ipynb`. Consult the [Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html) for more information about running Jupyter.

## Writing notebooks
Notebooks are made up of cells. Each cell can be markdown or code. Generally you'll have a markdown cell explaining the step you're at, and then a code cell that actually does the work. Create a new cell by clicking the plus icon in the toolbar. You can change the cell type by clicking on the dropdown on the right side of the toolbar. You can run code by clicking on a code cell and then clicking the 'Run' button in the toolbar. If the code generates any output (like a visualization) it will pop up below the code cell.
