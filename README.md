# Welcome to the Hitchhiker's Guide!
This repository is intended to be the conclusive resource for all members of the 4th Paradigm. 

## Usage
This repository is meant to be read straight from GitHub.com. There is no executable code and there are no requirements. Feel free to fork and adapt for yourself.

## Structure
This guide is divided into folders. The "guide" part lives mostly in `tutorials` and `guides`.

* `tutorials`: "how to's"; step by step instructions on how to accomplish something specific (e.g. how to configure a data science environment, how to create a linear regression)
* `guides`: in depth descriptions of tools, concepts, models, etc. (e.g. everything you need to know about jupyter, overview of numpy, overview of scikit learn)
* `nibbles`: one pagers (e.g. 10 keyboard shortcuts for jupyter, picking an IDE, shell commands you should know)
* `principles`: best practices, conventions, and conduct
